# CrypToFiat

Extension Link:

A Chromium extension that converts any instance of a fiat currency displayed on a page (USD) into its equivalent real-time value for any chosen cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, SOL, XMR). 


DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a copy of CryptoFiat by Cl√©ment Walter (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cryptofiat/pedmnoapknnagbagpnkmlncaeapljhan). That extension does not work, it does not convert from fiat currency to cryptocurrency as it's advertised to do. My extension also has key distinctions (e.g. more cryptocurrencies available, ability to switch extension on/off, and it actually works as advertised). I formulated this project idea and name before searching if anybody had done it before on the Chrome Web Store.
