# CrypToFiat

Extension Link:

A Chromium extension that converts any instance of a fiat currency displayed on a page (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, AED) into its equivalent real-time value for any chosen cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, SOL, XMR). 


DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a copy of CryptoFiat by Clément Walter (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cryptofiat/pedmnoapknnagbagpnkmlncaeapljhan). I formulated this project idea and name before searching if anybody had done it before on the Chrome Web Store. It has key distinctions from Clément Walter's extension.
